# Cafe Sales Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis project exploring cafe sales patterns and insights using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## About

This project was created by **Alan Tolubayev** for educational purposes, demonstrating data analysis techniques, visualization methods, and business insights extraction from sales data.

### The Story Behind This Project

As a star-shaped professional constantly seeking to level up with additional skills, I embarked on a journey to pursue a Master's degree in Data Science and AI last year. While the educational institution turned out to be a degree mill (leading to my withdrawal), some valuable projects remained—including this cafe sales analysis.

This project originated as my final assignment for a Data Analysis with Python class. What made it particularly engaging was the opportunity to step into the shoes of a data analyst on a mission to uncover hidden insights and provide actionable recommendations to cafe owners. The experience of transforming raw sales data into meaningful business intelligence was both challenging and rewarding.

The project showcases practical data science skills including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis and pattern recognition
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Business insight generation and recommendations
